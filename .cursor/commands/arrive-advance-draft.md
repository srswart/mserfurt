# ARRIVE Advance Draft

Generate or update an Advance file that documents the current change.

## Instructions

1. **Check current status** to understand the change scope:

```bash
arrive status
arrive score
```

2. **Generate the advance draft**:

```bash
arrive draft
```

3. **Read the generated advance file** to review its contents.

4. **Verify time tracking fields are present** (and add them if missing):
   - `started_at` should be set when the advance is created/drafted
   - `implementation_completed_at` should be set when implementation is finished (or `~` if not done yet)

5. **Enhance the advance** based on conversation context:
   - **Objective**: What problem are we solving? (from user's stated goal)
   - **Behavioral Change**: What will be different after this change?
   - **Implementation Tasks**: Break down the work (if not already done)
   - **Risk + Rollback**: Identify risks and how to revert
   - **Evidence**: What tests/verification will be done?

6. **If an advance already exists** (planned status):
   - Read the existing advance
   - Update sections that need refinement
   - Don't overwrite user's custom content

## Drafting Guidelines

### Objective
- One sentence explaining WHY this change exists
- Focus on the problem being solved, not the solution

### Behavioral Change
- Describe what's different AFTER this change ships
- Use "After this advance:" bullet format
- Be specific about observable changes

### Implementation Tasks
- Break into logical phases
- Include tidying, testing, and feature work
- Mark completed items as done

### Risk + Rollback
- Identify what could go wrong
- Describe how to undo the change
- Note any dependencies or migration concerns

### Evidence
- List verification methods
- Include test types (unit, integration, manual)
- Note any TDD/Tidy First practices used

## Expected Output Format
